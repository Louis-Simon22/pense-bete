A young couple from rival rich families are about to marry. Everyone's saying that the wedding will bring peace to their warring families. Bride and groom are both beautiful and impressive. You envy them.

The ceremony is to be held in a field near a forest outside the city. Everyone flocks to it like a bunch of carrion birds to a carcass. There will be gifts for attendees you see. As you also make your way to the wedding, a gang of teenagers ambush you, threathening to beat you up if you attend.

Dejected, you turn around and pretend to be heading for home, but you know these woods. A small trail takes you around the wedding location just as the ceremony approaches its climax. As the tradition goes, the groom chases the bride in the woods after the exchange of vows. 

The chase starts playfully, then degenerates into a fight for their lives as they pull knives on each other. Had both families been plotting a murder? They head in your direction, so you hide in a bush. As the man catches up to his fleeing bride they start stabbing each other repeatedly. You watch in a daze until both of them collapse to the ground, lifeless.

The teenagers from earlier spot you hiding near the corpses and call you murderer. You panic and run wherever your feet take you. You can hear the crowd of wedding attendees pursuing you. You instinctively run to the most beautiful building in town: made entirely of big stones, the facade is covered in reliefs and statues. It has a huge spire that dominates the surroundings. The ceilings and statues are covered in gold leaf, with beautiful mosaic floors. The crowd bursts the building's doors open and the cacophony of their cries makes it inside: "Death to the murderer!". You head to the heart of the building, below the spire, in a locked golden room. The crowd starts looting the place, pocketing all precious objects and scrapping the gold from the statues. This gives you time to force the inner room's doors open.

Inside is a tall pedestal of marble upon which sits a sacred book. The pedestal is so tall that you can't even see what's on top, but you know the book is there. You jump again and again, extending your arm but to no avail. You throw your body at the pedestal, but it won't budge. "What am I even doing here?" you wonder. You had promised yourself never to come here, that you're better than this. That's when you notice a page of the book is hanging out the back of the pedestal. In a last ditch effort you reach for it and manage to rip off a small piece, no bigger than a finger. You can't even read the old language written on it, but it comforts you. You bring it reverently into the main room, then outside. You face the mob with the piece of the book held before you and it blows all your accusers away. 

They vanish... to dust.
